/**
 `FICImageTable` is the primary class that efficiently stores and retrieves cached image data. Image tables are defined by instances of `<FICImageFormat>`. Each image table is backed by a single
 file on disk that sequentially stores image entry data. All images in an image table are either opaque or not and have the same dimensions. Therefore, when defining your image formats, keep in
 mind that you cannot mix image dimensions or whether or not an image is opaque.
