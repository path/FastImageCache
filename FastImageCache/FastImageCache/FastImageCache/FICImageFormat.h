 `FICImageFormat` acts as a definition for the types of images that are stored in the image cache. Each image format must have a unique name, but multiple formats can belong to the same family.
 All images associated with a particular format must have the same image dimentions and opacity preference. You can define the maximum number of entries that an image format can accommodate to
 prevent the image cache from consuming too much disk space. Each `<FICImageTable>` managed by the image cache is associated with a single image format.

/**
 The optional family that the image format belongs to. Families group together related image formats.
 
 @discussion If you are using the image cache to create several different cached variants of the same source image, all of those variants would be unique image formats that share the same family.
 
 For example, you might define a `userPhoto` family that groups together image formats with the following names: `userPhotoSmallThumbnail`, `userPhotoLargeThumbnail`, `userPhotoLargeThumbnailBorder`.
 Ideally, the same source image can be processed to create cached image data for every image format belonging to the same family.
 
 `<FICImageCache>` provides its delegate a chance to process all image formats in a given family at the same time when a particular entity-image format pair is being processed. This allows you to process
 a source image once instead of having to download and process the same source image multiple times for different formats in the same family.

 A bitmask of type `<FICImageFormatStyle>` that defines the style of the image format.
 
 `FICImageFormatStyle` has the following values:
 
 - `FICImageFormatStyle32BitBGRA`: Full-color image format with alpha channel. 8 bits per color component, and 8 bits for the alpha channel.
 - `FICImageFormatStyle32BitBGR`: Full-color image format with no alpha channel. 8 bits per color component. The remaining 8 bits are unused.
 - `FICImageFormatStyle16BitBGR`: Reduced-color image format with no alpha channel. 5 bits per color component. The remaining bit is unused.
 - `FICImageFormatStyle8BitGrayscale`: Grayscale-only image format with no alpha channel.
 
 If you are storing images without an alpha component (e.g., JPEG images), then you should use the `FICImageFormatStyle32BitBGR` style for performance reasons. If you are storing very small images or images
 without a great deal of color complexity, the `FICImageFormatStyle16BitBGR` style may be sufficient and uses less disk space than the 32-bit styles use. For grayscale-only image formats, the
 `FICImageFormatStyle8BitGrayscale` style is sufficient and further reduces disk space usage.

 The data protection mode that image table files will be created with.
 
 `FICImageFormatProtectionMode` has the following values:
 
 - `FICImageFormatProtectionModeNone`: No data protection is used. The image table file backing this image format will always be available for reading and writing.
 - `FICImageFormatProtectionModeComplete`: Complete data protection is used. As soon as the system enables data protection (i.e., when the device is locked), the image table file backing this image
 format will not be available for reading and writing. As a result, images of this format should not be requested by Fast Image Cache when executing backgrounded code.
 - `FICImageFormatProtectionModeCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication`: Partial data protection is used. After a device restart, until the user unlocks the device for the first time, complete data
 protection is in effect. However, after the device has been unlocked for the first time, the image table file backing this image format will remain available for readin and writing. This mode may be
 a good compromise between encrypting image table files after the device powers down and allowing the files to be accessed successfully by Fast Image Cache, whether or not the device is subsequently
 locked.
 
 @note Data protection can prevent Fast Image Cache from accessing its image table files to read and write image data. If the image data being stored in Fast Image Cache is not sensitive in nature,
 consider using `FICImageFormatProtectionModeNone` to prevent any issues accessing image table files when the disk is encrypted.
