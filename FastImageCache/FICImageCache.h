/**
 `FICImageCache` is the primary class for managing and interacting with the image cache. Applications using the image cache create one or more `<FICImageFormat>`
 objects. These formats effectively act as logical groupings for image data stored in the image cache. An `<FICImageTable>` object is created for each format defined by
 your application to allow for efficient storage and retrieval of image data. Image data is keyed off of objects conforming to the `<FICEntity>` protocol as well as an
 image format name.

 @discussion A source image is usually the original, full-size image that represents an entity. This source image is processed for every unique format to create the
 actual image data to be stored in the image cache. This method is an asynchronous data provider, so nothing is actually returned to the sender. Instead, the delegate's
 implementation is expected to call the completion block once an image is available.
 
 Fast Image Cache is architected under the typical design pattern whereby model objects provide a URL to certain image assets and allow the client to actually retrieve
 the images via network requests only when needed. As a result, the implementation of this method will usually involve creating an asynchronous network request using
 the URL returned by <[FICEntity sourceImageURLWithFormatName:]>, deserializing the image data when the request completes, and finally calling this method's completion
 block to provide the image cache with the source image.
